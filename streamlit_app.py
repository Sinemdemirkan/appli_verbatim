Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To dieâ€”to sleep,
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to dreamâ€”ay, there's the rub:
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pauseâ€”there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.

Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times
on the castle door.
The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired
witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very
stern face and Harryâ€™s first thought was that this was not
someone to cross.
â€˜The firsâ€™-years, Professor McGonagall,â€™ said Hagrid.
â€˜Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.â€™
She pulled the door wide. The Entrance Hall was so big
you could have fitted the whole of the Dursleysâ€™ house in
it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the
ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out,
and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to
the upper floors.
